Shopping and tracker orders project

Objective: Make a shopping products store and tracking orders, with hexagonal architecture in the backend.

Pending backend: Auth and user roles/permissions 
External API: https://openweathermap.org/api This API is used to get the city weather when doing the order. If it's raining it will add a suplement of 2â‚¬ to the order.
