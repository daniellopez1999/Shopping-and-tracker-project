### Shopping and tracker orders project

Objective: Make a shopping products store and tracking orders, with hexagonal architecture in the backend.

### Tech Stack

Backend: Node | Express (TypeScript)  
Frontend: React (TypeScript)  
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose as ODM  
Container App Development: Docker

### External API

https://openweathermap.org/api This API is used to get the city weather when doing the order. If it's raining it will add a suplement of 2â‚¬ to the order.  
https://resend.com/ This API is used to send email when creating and order, and when changing the status of the order i.e: From Accepted to Delivered.

### Pending

Pending frontend: Most of the frontend

### Installation

### Docker Installation

#### Run the following commands after cloning the repository and making sure Docker is installed in your computer:

cd backend  
docker-compose build  
docker-compose up  
The above command will run App and MongoDB, wait some seconds until App is Running please.

### Docker Configuration

If you use the above .ENV configuration, you should not change the docker-compose.yml configuration file, but if you want to, make sure the ports from docker-compose.yml are the same from the .env
If you change the app service port, make sure to change it also in Postman.

### .ENV Backend File needs:

#### PORT

#### DB_URL

#### WEATHER_API_KEY

#### RESSEND_EMAIL

#### JWT_SECRET

#### JWT_EXPIRES

### .ENV Backend Example:

#### PORT: '4000'

#### DB_URL: 'mongodb://mongodb/shopping-project'

#### WEATHER_API_KEY: //Get your key at https://openweathermap.org/api

#### RESSEND_EMAIL: //Get your key at https://resend.com/

#### JWT_SECRET: //Generate your JWT_SECRET with the following code example: console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))

#### JWT_EXPIRES: '1d'


### Extra steps (not needed, but recommended):

#### To Create 10 default products use the following endpoint:   
http://localhost:4000/api/products/create-products-template   
The API Call is in the Postman Collection -> Products -> Template Create Products
